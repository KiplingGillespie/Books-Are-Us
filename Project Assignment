Introduction
You have been allocated to a project group. Each group has been given a User Story.
So, what are we doing?
We want to write a program that meets the user story. However, the user story is too broad. We will use
the Agile method to develop the program. I will be leaving about five minutes at the end of each class
to let the group hold a Scrum meeting.
I assume that you will initially develop a simple program and show it to me. I will give you a more
detailed user story after you show your program to me. We will repeat this process until the program
meets my requirements.
You need to plan your tasks each time you get a user story. As the user story gets more detailed, you
will need to allocate tasks to members of the group. Each scrum meeting will look at what each member
planned to do as presented at the last scrum meeting, what has been achieved, and what will be done by
such-such a day.
You may want to find a free software repository website where you post software that has been
developed by group members as well as any relevant communication. In the past some students used
Assembla.com for their repository.
Requirements
You will need to provide plans and programs.
All the program files must compile.
Deliverables
You will submit on Blackboard your plans over the project period and the software that you developed.
